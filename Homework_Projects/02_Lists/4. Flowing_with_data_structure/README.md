## ðŸ§  Mutable VS Immutable Data Types
This program demonstrates the difference between mutable and immutable data types. It takes an input string (immutable) and appends three copies of it into a list (mutable) using a function. The example highlights how mutable data types like lists can be directly modified within functions, while immutable types like strings remain unchanged.
