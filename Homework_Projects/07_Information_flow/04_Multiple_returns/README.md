## ðŸ“Š Website Sign-Up Data Collector
This program simulates collecting user data during a website sign-up process. It defines a helper function get_user_info() that prompts the user for their first name, last name, and email address, and returns these three values as a tuple.

The main() function calls this helper, stores the returned data in user_data, and then prints it out in a summary message.
