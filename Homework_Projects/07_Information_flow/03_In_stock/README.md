## üçé Sophia's Fruit Store Inventory Checker
This program simulates a simple fruit inventory lookup system. It defines a function num_in_stock(fruit) that returns the stock quantity for specific fruits: "apple", "durian", and "pear". 
If the input fruit is not recognized, it returns 0. The main() function prompts the user to enter a fruit name, checks its stock, and displays an appropriate message about its availability.
