## ðŸ“… Leap Year
This program prompts the user to input a year and checks whether that year is a leap year. It uses the rules for leap years: a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The program then prints whether the year is a leap year or not.
