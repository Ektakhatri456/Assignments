## 🗳️ Voting Eligibility Checker
This program asks the user for their age and determines whether they are eligible to vote in three fictional countries: Peturksbouipo, Stanlau, and Mayengua. Each country has a different voting age requirement. Based on the user's input, the program informs them whether they can or cannot vote in each of the three countries.
