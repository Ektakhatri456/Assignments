## ðŸŽ¢ Ride Height Checker
This program asks the user for their height in inches and compares it with a pre-specified minimum height (70 inches). If the user's height is greater than or equal to the minimum height, the program informs them that they are tall enough to ride. Otherwise, it encourages them to try again next year.
