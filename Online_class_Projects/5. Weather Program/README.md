# ☁️ Weather Information Fetcher
A simple Python program that fetches real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It prompts the user for a city name, sends an API request using the requests library, and neatly displays the complete JSON response with the help of pprint. This project demonstrates how to interact with external APIs and handle JSON data in Python.
