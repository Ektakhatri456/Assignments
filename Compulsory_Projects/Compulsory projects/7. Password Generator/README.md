# 🔐 Password Generator 

A simple Python-based password generator that creates strong, random passwords based on user preferences.

## 📌 How it works:

- The program asks the user how many characters each password should have.

- It then asks how many passwords to generate.

- Using a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, the program generates secure passwords and displays them.
