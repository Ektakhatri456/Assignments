# ðŸŽ‰ Mad Libs Python Project

A fun interactive console-based Python program where users fill in the blanks to complete a humorous story.

â€¢ Prompts the user for different types of inputs like names, places, adjectives, animals, verbs, and objects.

â€¢ Dynamically generates a quirky story by inserting the user inputs into a predefined sentence structure.

â€¢ Great for practicing string formatting and user input handling in Python.
