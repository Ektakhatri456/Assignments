# ðŸ“Š Number Guessing Game (Computer as Guesser)
A fun Python program where the computer tries to guess a number youâ€™re thinking of between 1 and a specified upper limit. You give feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct â€” and the computer narrows down the range accordingly.

ðŸ“Œ How it works:

â€¢ The computer makes a random guess within the current range.

â€¢ You respond:

   H â†’ too high

   L â†’ too low

   C â†’ correct

â€¢ The computer adjusts its next guess based on your feedback until it guesses correctly.
