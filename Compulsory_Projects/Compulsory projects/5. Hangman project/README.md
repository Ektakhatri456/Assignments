# 🎲 Hangman Word Guessing Game

A classic Python console game where you try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time before running out of lives.

📌 How it works:

- A random word is selected from a predefined list.

- You guess letters one by one.

- If the guessed letter is in the word, it reveals its position(s).

- Every wrong guess costs you a life (you start with 6 lives).

- The game continues until:

You guess all the letters correctly (🎉 victory!)

Or you run out of lives (💀 game over)
