# ⏳ Countdown Timer Python Project

A simple console-based countdown timer built in Python. The program lets the user enter a specific time in seconds and counts down to zero, updating the time every second.

📌 How it works:

- User inputs the countdown duration in seconds.

- The program displays the remaining time in MM:SS format.

- It refreshes the display every second until the timer hits zero.

- At the end, a message confirms that the countdown has completed.
