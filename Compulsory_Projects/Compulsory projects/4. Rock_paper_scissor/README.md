# ðŸŽ® Rock Paper Scissors Game
A simple interactive Python program where you can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## ðŸ“Œ How it works:

â€¢ The player selects either rock (r), paper (p), or scissors (s).

â€¢ The computer randomly chooses one of the three options.

â€¢ The program compares both choices:

â€¢ If choices match â†’ itâ€™s a tie.

â€¢ Rock crushes Scissors

â€¢ Scissors cuts Paper

â€¢ Paper covers Rock

â€¢ Displays whether you won, lost, or tied.
